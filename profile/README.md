# University of Pennsylvania GitHub Campus Program
GitHub Campus Program makes GitHub Enterprise features available to the Penn Community.

## University of Pennsylvania GitHub Organization
You must have a GitHub account before you can become a member of the University of Pennsylvania (upenn) organization on GitHub. You can use an existing account or create a new GitHub account here:

* [Join GitHub](https://github.com/)

You can use any available name for your GitHub account. If your PennKey username (PennName) is unavailable, consider using yourpennname-upenn (i.e. bfrankln-upenn). Since GitHub account names are not unique to the **upenn** organization, do not assume that a GitHub account belongs to a Penn affiliate because it is the same as someone’s PennName.

All members of the **upenn** GitHub organization are required to have two-factor authentication enabled on their GitHub accounts. If you have not done so already, see these instructions (be sure to save your recovery codes when prompted):

* [Configuring two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication)

After logging into your GitHub account (with two-factor authentication enabled), visit this URL to authenticate with your PennKey and automatically become a member of the upenn GitHub organization:

* [https://github.com/orgs/upenn/sso/sign_up](https://github.com/orgs/upenn/sso/sign_up)

Note that you can associate your Penn WebLogin SSO identity with any of your GitHub accounts, but only one can be associated at a time. You will also be required to enable [Two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication) on your GitHub account, if you haven't done so already.

**WARNING:** GitHub is not suitable for storing sensitive information, including:

* Data subject to FERPA rules
* HIPAA protected information
* Unencrypted secrets such as passwords or private keys
